Hi, I’m @christian43 and i am interested in analysing data from different sources and delivering data-driven decision support. 
Ideally these data sources are connected with sport areas such as performance, movements, training or competition. But does not have to. 
I’m currently learning Julia. 

You can reach me by email: christian.saal@uni-leipzig.de
